# 📊 Insight_Places - Study Summary (July 1, 2025)

## 📝 Overview
Today I started my journey learning SQL with the `insight_places` database.  
I focused on creating tables, inserting data, altering table structures, and writing basic queries to manipulate and retrieve data.

## 🗂️ Scripts Created
- Created 6 tables: `owners`, `addresses`, `bookings`, `clients`, `reservations`, `ratings`  
- Inserted data into all tables (bulk inserts for owners, bookings, clients, etc.)  
- Altered tables by adding columns and renaming tables/columns  
- Wrote basic select queries to analyze data such as:
  - High rated bookings
  - Active hotel bookings
  - Average ticket per client
  - Average stay duration per client
  - Top active and inactive owners  
- Created delete scripts to remove related bookings, reservations, and ratings data

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Continue practicing SQL queries focusing on more complex joins and aggregations  
- Start exploring stored procedures and triggers  
- Keep organizing scripts with clear commits and documentation
